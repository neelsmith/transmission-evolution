# transmission-evolution

This repository hosts collaborative work comparing the analysis of transmission and evolution of biological and cultural material.

We're organizing our work for summer, 2020, in [the project wiki](https://github.com/neelsmith/transmission-evolution/wiki).

Source for a public-facing web site about our work is in the `docs` directory, and is published to [https://neelsmith.github.io/transmission-evolution/](https://neelsmith.github.io/transmission-evolution/).
