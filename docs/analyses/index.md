We are primarily presenting analyses in Jupyter notebooks available from github that can be run on `mybinder.org`.


## Data preparation

- [convert citable editions of Greek texts to a simplified ASCII format](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neelsmith/summer2020nbs/master?filepath=make-ascii-corpus.ipynb) (useful for computing edit distances and other analyses) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neelsmith/summer2020nbs/master?filepath=make-ascii-corpus.ipynb)
- compute word counts to guide manual construction of stop-words list for topic modelling

## Analyzing *Iliad* texts

- compute vertical variation
- compute horizontal variation
- construt an evolutionary tree

## Analyzing *scholia*

- construct topic models
