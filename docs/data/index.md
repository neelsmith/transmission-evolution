## Diplomatic editions of texts

Full diplomatic editions in Unicode Greek:

- `texts/diplomatic/hmt-2020i-textcorpus.cex` is the `2020i` release from the [published releases of the Homer Multitext project archive](https://github.com/homermultitext/hmt-archive/tree/master/releases-cex).
- `texts/diplomatic/twins9corpus.cex` is built from editions not yet published in a HMT project release, but available from [this github repository](https://github.com/hmteditors/twins-alpha)


Case-insensitive diplomatic editions in simplified ASCII form with breathings and accents stripped are generated using code in [this Jupyter notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neelsmith/summer2020nbs/master?filepath=make-ascii-corpus.ipynb).  They are available in the [texts/diplomatic/ascii](https://github.com/neelsmith/transmission-evolution/tree/master/data/texts/diplomatic/ascii) directory.
